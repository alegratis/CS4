# Welland Canal Status

I created this live project to have a better experience while driving around the Niagara Region.

Other solutions do exist, but they are either paid or not super user friendly.

## Built with Vite and React

For this project I used Vite with React, as the hot reloading function makes visualizing changes and absolute breeze.

## Public API Access

This app was developed and deployed in two parts, one of a server that retrieves the info from the [canalstatus.com API](https://canalstatus.com/documentation)
and delivering it in a more mobile friendly interface.

## Work In Progress

Even though the basic functionality is all that is needed for every day use, I will continue to add to this, and potentially translate the code into native platforms in the future. The next step will be to turn this into a PWA.
