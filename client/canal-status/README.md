# CMS - Desktop Dashboard

This isa quick mockup of what a CMS front end could look like, along with some functionality and fun easter eggs.

## Built with Vite and React

For this project I used Vite with React, as the hot reloading function makes visualizing changes and absolute breeze.

## Puppies page is functional

For lack of imagination. I added a "Puppies" link on the sidebar, and was then asked to make it functional, as it is not fair to tempt people with the idea of a puppy and then not delivering on that. So the Puppies page displays a simple interface with a heading, a photo and a button to retrieve a new pup. This is all thanks to the public [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/)

## Work In Progress

Next plan is to make this site fully responsive and add more functionality to the rest of the pages, the main idea of this demo was to create a mockup for a working sidebar. Getting there!
